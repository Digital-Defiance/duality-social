## Background Workers
References: `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker`, `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker-e2e`

The background worker processes in the Duality Social application are responsible for performing various tasks, such as querying the database and logging posts with missing AI-generated viewpoints.

The key functionality of the background worker processes is implemented in the `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker` directory. This directory contains the main application that is responsible for the following tasks:

- Setting up the database connection and configuration
- Querying the "Post" collection in the MongoDB database and logging the retrieved posts

The entry point of the application is the [`main.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/main.ts#L0) file, which sets up the database connection and then queries the "Post" collection to find all posts where the "aiVpId" field is null. The retrieved posts are then logged to the console, and the database connection is closed.

The database connection and configuration are handled by the [`setupDatabase()`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L6) function, which is defined in the [`setupDatabase.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L0) file. This function establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library and sets several connection options, such as timeouts and queue timeouts.

The environment-specific configuration for the background worker application is stored in the `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/src/environments` directory. This includes the production and non-production settings, such as the MongoDB connection URI.

The background worker application also includes a Jest configuration file (`/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/jest.config.ts`) that sets up the testing environment and specifies the transformation rules for TypeScript files.
