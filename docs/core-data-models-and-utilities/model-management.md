### Model Management

References: `/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models`

The [`BaseModel`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L32) class and its associated functionality provide a centralized way to create, retrieve, and interact with Mongoose models used throughout the Duality Social application.

The [`Base`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L10) class is an abstract class that serves as a registry for Mongoose models. It maintains a static [`ModelRegistry`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L11) map to keep track of all the registered models. The [`getModel()`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L24) method of the [`Base`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L10) class retrieves a registered Mongoose model by its [`ModelName`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/enumerations/modelName.ts#L1) enum value.

The [`BaseModel`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L32) class extends the [`Base`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L10) class and provides a more specialized implementation for managing Mongoose models. It has several properties, including [`Name`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L39), [`Path`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L40), [`Schema`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L41), [`Collection`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L42), and [`Model`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schemaModelData.ts#L30), which are initialized based on the provided [`IModelData`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/interfaces/modelData.ts#L5) interface.

The key functionality of the [`BaseModel`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L32) class includes:

- [`create()`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schema.ts#L28): This is a static method that creates a new [`BaseModel`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L32) instance by using the provided [`IModelData`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/interfaces/modelData.ts#L5) and registering the model with the [`ModelRegistry`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L11).
- [`getModelData()`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/services/feed.ts#L11): This is a static method that retrieves the [`IModelData`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/interfaces/modelData.ts#L5) for a given [`ModelName`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/enumerations/modelName.ts#L1) enum value.

The [`BaseModel`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L32) class and its associated functionality provide a centralized and consistent way to manage Mongoose models throughout the Duality Social application. By encapsulating the model creation and retrieval logic, the [`BaseModel`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/models/baseModel.ts#L32) class helps ensure maintainability and reduces duplication of model-related code across the codebase.
