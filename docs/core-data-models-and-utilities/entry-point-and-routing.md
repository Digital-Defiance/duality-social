### Entry Point and Routing
References: `/apps/duality-social-react/src/app`

The main entry point of the Duality Social React application is located in the `/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx` file. This file contains the [`App`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L9) component, which is responsible for setting up the initial rendering of the React application and providing the necessary routing functionality.

The [`App`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L9) component uses the [`useState`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L1) and [`useEffect`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L1) hooks to manage the authentication state of the user. The [`getToken()`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L3) and [`verifyToken()`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L7) functions are used to retrieve and verify the user's token, respectively. This allows the component to dynamically render the navigation menu based on the user's authentication status.

The component uses the [`Routes`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L5) and [`Route`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L5) components from the [`react-router-dom`](/package.json#L76) library to define the different routes and their corresponding components. The home page, profile page, and login page are all rendered as separate routes within the [`App`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/app/app.tsx#L9) component.
