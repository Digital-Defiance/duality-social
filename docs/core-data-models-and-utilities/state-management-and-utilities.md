### State Management and Utilities
References: `/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils`

The `/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils` directory contains utility functions and modules that provide various supporting functionality for the Duality Social React application.

The [`auth.ts`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L0) file provides functions to handle user authentication, such as retrieving and verifying JWT tokens, and extracting user details from the token. The [`getToken()`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L3) function retrieves the user's authentication token from the browser's local storage. The [`verifyToken()`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L7) function takes a token as input and attempts to decode it using the [`jwtDecode`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L1) library, returning [`true`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schemas/user.ts#L19) if the token is valid and [`false`](/apps/duality-social-react/project.json#L30) otherwise. The [`getUserDetails()`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L17) function also uses [`jwtDecode`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/auth.ts#L1) to extract the user's details from the provided token, returning the decoded user details or [`null`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/cors.ts#L14) if the decoding is unsuccessful.

The [`reactions.ts`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/reactions.ts#L0) file defines a mapping between the [`DefaultReactionsTypeEnum`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/enumerations/defaultReactionsType.ts#L2) and their corresponding emoji representations, stored in the [`reactionEmojis`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/utils/reactions.ts#L3) object. This mapping allows the application to easily display the appropriate emoji for a given reaction type, which is likely used throughout the Duality Social React application when rendering user reactions to posts.
