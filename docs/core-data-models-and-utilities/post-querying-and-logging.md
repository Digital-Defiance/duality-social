### Post Querying and Logging
References: `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/src/main.ts`

The main functionality of the [`duality-social-queue-worker`](/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/project.json#L2) application is to query the "Post" collection in the MongoDB database and log all posts where the "aiVpId" field is null.

The application starts by importing the necessary environment configuration and setting up the database connection using the [`setupDatabase()`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L6) function. This function likely defines the "Post" model that is used to interact with the MongoDB database.

Once the database connection is established, the code retrieves all posts from the "Post" collection where the "aiVpId" field is null. This is done by accessing the "Post" model through the [`schema`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schemaModelData.ts#L35) object and using a query to filter the results.

The retrieved posts are then logged to the console, and the database connection is closed by calling [`db.disconnect()`](/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/src/main.ts#L16).

This background worker application serves an important purpose in the Duality Social platform by identifying posts that are missing AI-generated viewpoints, which can then be processed further or flagged for manual review.
