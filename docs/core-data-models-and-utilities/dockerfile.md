### Dockerfile
References: `/Dockerfile`

The `/Dockerfile` is responsible for setting up the development environment for the Duality Social application. It performs the following key tasks:

- **Base Image**: The Dockerfile uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-18-bullseye` image as the base, which provides a pre-configured Node.js development environment.

- **Dependencies Installation**: The Dockerfile installs additional dependencies, such as [`build-essential`](/Dockerfile#L3), [`python2`](/Dockerfile#L3), and global Node.js packages ([`npm`](/migrations.json#L31), [`nx`](/nx.json#L2), [`yarn`](/yarn.lock#L0)), to ensure the development environment is properly set up.

- **Application Code Copying**: The Dockerfile copies the application code, including the [`package.json`](/package.json#L0), [`package-lock.json`](/Dockerfile#L8) (or [`yarn.lock`](/yarn.lock#L0)), and the source code for the `/libs/duality-social-lib`, `/apps/duality-social-react`, and `/apps/duality-social-node` directories.

- **Application Building**: The Dockerfile runs the [`yarn fontawesome:setup`](/Dockerfile#L20), [`yarn all`](/Dockerfile#L21), and [`yarn all:build`](/Dockerfile#L22) commands to build the application.

- **Port Exposure**: The Dockerfile exposes port 3000, which is likely the port the application will run on.

- **Application Startup**: The Dockerfile sets the [`CMD`](/Dockerfile#L28) instruction to start the Node.js application, but the specific file to be run is not present in the provided code.
