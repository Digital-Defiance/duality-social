### Environment Configuration
References: `/apps/duality-social-react/src/environments`

The `/apps/duality-social-react/src/environments` directory contains two files that define the environment configuration for the [`duality-social-react`](/apps/duality-social-react/project.json#L2) application.

The [`environment.prod.ts`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/environments/environment.prod.ts#L0) file exports an [`environment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L21) object that implements the [`IEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L3) interface. This object has a single property, [`production`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L7), which is set to [`true`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schemas/user.ts#L19), indicating that the application is running in a production environment.

The [`environment.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L0) file also exports an [`environment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L21) object that implements the [`IEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L3) interface. In this case, the [`production`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L7) property is set to [`false`](/apps/duality-social-react/project.json#L30), indicating that this is a non-production environment, such as a development or staging environment.

The purpose of these configuration files is to provide a centralized location for defining the environment-specific settings for the [`duality-social-react`](/apps/duality-social-react/project.json#L2) application. This allows the application to behave differently based on the environment it is running in, such as using different API endpoints, enabling or disabling certain features, or adjusting logging and error handling.

The [`environment.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L0) file includes a comment that suggests the file can be replaced during the build process by using the [`fileReplacements`](/apps/duality-social-react/project.json#L36) array. This allows the environment configuration to be easily swapped out for a different configuration, such as the [`environment.prod.ts`](/apps/duality-social-react/src/environments/environment.prod.ts#L0) file, when building the application for production.
