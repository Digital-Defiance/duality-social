### Routing and Configuration
References: `/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts`, `/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes/api.route.ts`

The [`api.route.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes/api.route.ts#L0) file in the `/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes` directory sets up the main API routes for the Duality Social application. It defines two sub-routers: `/feed` and `/user`, which are handled by the [`FeedController`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/controllers/api/feed.ts#L5) and [`UserController`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/controllers/api/user.ts#L4) classes, respectively.

The [`FeedController`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/controllers/api/feed.ts#L5) and [`UserController`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/controllers/api/user.ts#L4) classes are responsible for handling the API routes related to the user's social feed and user-specific functionality, such as authentication and profile management. These classes are imported and instantiated as [`feedController`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes/api.route.ts#L8) and [`userController`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes/api.route.ts#L9) objects, which are then used to set up the corresponding sub-routers within the [`apiRouter`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes/api.route.ts#L6).

The file serves as the entry point for the API, handling all routes prefixed with `/api` and ensuring that they are authenticated. It also includes a commented-out section for an [`openAiRouter`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/routes/api.route.ts#L14), suggesting the potential for future integration with OpenAI.

The environment configuration for the backend API is defined in the `/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts` file. This file exports an [`IEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L3) interface that represents the configuration settings for the application, including properties for the production environment, site URL, developer settings, OpenAI integration, MongoDB connection, cookie settings, and Pusher integration.

The [`validateEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L34) function in this file checks if the required environment variables are set, such as the OpenAI API key, Express session secret, and MongoDB connection URI. If any of these variables are not set, the function throws an error with a corresponding message.
