### Jest Configuration
References: `/jest.config.ts`, `/jest.preset.js`

The [`jest.config.ts`](/jest.config.ts#L0) file in the `/duality-social` project is a configuration file for the Jest testing framework. It uses the [`getJestProjects()`](/jest.config.ts#L1) function from the `@nrwl/jest` package to set up multiple Jest projects for the application.

The [`jest.preset.js`](/jest.preset.js#L0) file in the `/duality-social` project is a configuration file that imports the default preset from the `@nrwl/jest/preset` module and exports it as the configuration for the project.

These configuration files are responsible for setting up the Jest testing environment for the [`duality-social`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/duality-social-lib.ts#L0) project. The [`jest.config.ts`](/jest.config.ts#L0) file leverages the [`getJestProjects()`](/jest.config.ts#L1) function to generate the Jest configuration for multiple projects within the monorepo, while the [`jest.preset.js`](/jest.preset.js#L0) file imports and exports the default Nx preset to provide a pre-configured testing environment.
