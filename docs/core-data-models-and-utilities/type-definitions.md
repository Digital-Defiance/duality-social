### Type Definitions

References: `/apps/duality-social-react/src/interfaces`

The `/apps/duality-social-react/src/interfaces` directory contains a set of TypeScript interface definitions that provide a consistent and type-safe way to work with the various data structures and configurations used throughout the Duality Social React application.

The key interface defined in this directory is:

[`IEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L3): This interface defines the environment configuration for the application, including a [`production`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L7) property that indicates whether the application is running in a production environment or not. This interface is likely used throughout the application to make decisions based on the current environment, such as enabling or disabling certain features or adjusting logging and error handling behavior.
