### Environment Setup
References: `/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts`, `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/src/setupDatabase.ts`

The [`environment.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L0) file in the `/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts` directory defines the configuration settings for the Duality Social application. This file exports an [`IEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L3) interface that represents the various environment-specific settings, such as the production environment, site URL, developer settings, OpenAI integration, MongoDB connection, cookie settings, and Pusher integration.

The [`validateEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L34) function in this file is responsible for ensuring that the required environment variables are set. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the following variables:

- [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](/README.md#L11): the access token for the OpenAI integration.
- [`EXPRESS_SESSION_SECRET`](/README.md#L11): the secret for the Express session.
- [`MONGO_URI`](/apps/duality-social-node/.env.example#L1): the MongoDB connection URI.

If any of these variables are not set, the [`validateEnvironment`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/interfaces/environment.ts#L34) function will throw an error with a corresponding message. This helps to catch any missing or invalid configuration settings early in the application's lifecycle, which can prevent runtime errors and ensure a smooth deployment.

The `/apps/duality-social-queue-worker/src/setupDatabase.ts` file sets up the connection to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. The [`setupDatabase()`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L6) function performs the following steps:

- Sets the [`strictQuery`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L7) option of Mongoose to [`true`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schemas/user.ts#L19).
- Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the [`connect()`](/apps/duality-social-node/yarn.lock#L17) function from Mongoose, with the connection URL retrieved from the [`environment.mongo.uri`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L8) property.
- Sets several connection options, including [`socketTimeoutMS`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L9), [`connectTimeoutMS`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L10), and [`waitQueueTimeoutMS`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L11), which control the timeout behavior of the database connection.
- Returns an object with two properties:
  - [`db`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L8): the Mongoose instance representing the database connection.
  - [`schema`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schemaModelData.ts#L35): the [`SchemaModels`](/libs/duality-social-lib/src/lib/schema.ts#L27) object, which likely contains the database schema definitions.

The setup and configuration of the development environment, including environment variables and database connections, is a critical aspect of the Duality Social application. The [`environment.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/environment.ts#L0) file and the [`setupDatabase()`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L6) function in [`setupDatabase.ts`](/apps/duality-social-node/src/setupDatabase.ts#L0) play a key role in ensuring that the necessary configuration settings are in place and that the application can successfully connect to the MongoDB database.
